About
=====

This is a Single Page App that allows you to browse GitHub issues
for a given repository.

SPA Files Layout
================

Javascript
 - main.js      Main
 - app/         The SPA files
 - libs/        External libraries
                (_, jquery, backbone, marionettejs, jquery-ui)

HTML / Template
 - index.html                   Contain the main layout for the SPA as well as
                                the templates bits.

CSS / Styling
 - base.scss                    SCSS
 - config.rb                    SCSS configuration (for compass)
 - base.css                     Generated stylesheet

To re-generate the style sheet use 'compass' in scss/, either with 'compile' or
'watch' (if you want live code/generation on save) options.

Notes on dev
============

Well, basically I had to learn how to program some modern client-side JS,
Backbone and all that jazz...

As instructed all this app was coded from scratch, using no particular IDE but
my plain old emacs (and fingers).

In this exercise, I've tried to make my code minimal, use libraries / framework
for what they are. I do realize there are still few points that I don't fully get
and probably still looks ugly in this sample app (specially Marionette ;)

Even though I might not have all the latest tricks or coolest design patterns at
hands, I've tried to write elegant code and keep everything clean that  should
be fairly maintainable and robust over time.

What is missing or not in this app (but that wasn't the goal)
 - Some unit testing and other code enforcing / QA improvements (from jslint
     to jasmin etc...)
 - Validation for all user inputs, right? :)
 - SPA / Module packaging, folding everything under nice class names, compact
     scripts in 1 file .min.js
 - Scoping and modern JS wrapping, require and such...
 - Less agressive view rendering, re-use layout/views... (would need refactoring :)
 - more 42!

It's "Turtles all the way down"...
